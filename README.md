# Coding Assignment

The goal is to demonstrate your ability to build features and your coding style. Given the limited time, you will have to decide what to prioritize, balancing clean code and completing the assignment.

The app is small but one could easily spend many days working on it: creating a beautiful UI, testing every method or carefully optimizing each line of code. Do as much as you can in two hours and share the results.

## Getting Started

*Do not fork* this repo. Instead download the zip.

Then install the packages and you're good to go!

```bash
npm install

# run app
npm run start

# run tests
npm run test
```

## Tasks managing application

Build a task managing app, where the user can add, filter, assign, and complete tasks.

* The app should have two screens: the list screen and the details screen. Use the Angular router to manage the
  transitions between them.
* Use your favorite library for state management, you can use a different approach if you think it fits better.
* Write a few tests. The goal here is not to build a production-quality app, so don't test every single detail.
  Two or three tests should be good enough.
* Don't forget about error handling and race conditions.

## Submitting your solution
